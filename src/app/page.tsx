export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div className="flex h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center">
      <a href="./products" className="text-center text-xl hover:text-blue-600">
        To the /products page
      </a>
      <p>
        I updated the 'Uke 40' project to take POST requests. I added a form to
        the products page in which all properties of a product can be entered.
        You can then click the 'Send a post request' button which adds the
        Product to the ProductList and then rerenders the ProductList. The
        insert isn't permanent however, as no database is present in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would be interested to know if I should use .then() after my POST
        request if my fetch is async and I've used 'await'. See
        components/PostButton: line 39.
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
